The social media system I choose for assignment 1 was probably reddit and the part of it that I would like to write the TDD approach for is post creation.
The first test to create would be to redirect o the error 404 page if the post is not found. Then we would go about writing the code with the goal of
checking if a post with a specified ID exists. Then we would write a test to see if users can access private posts or not. After the test we will write the code to check
if the post is private or public and if private display a private post error/announcement, if it is not a private post display it. Then we would write a test that creates a post and tries to find it by ID.
After the test we will need to create functionality to make a post on the client side and send it to the server side.
